# The Weather App

## Description
   This is a simple application which tells the user about the weather of cities selected by the user. 
   Each user can customize the cities that they want to display.
   The project uses sqlite but i am later going to move it to postgres.
   I am also going to implement the complete CI/CD pipeline as part of the project.

## Dependencies
   All the dependancies are mentioned in the Pipfile.
   In addition to that you need to create a variable named "api_key" which will store the openweather api key for an individual.
